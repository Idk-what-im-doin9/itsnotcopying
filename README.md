### A website containing all of my grade 10 work, books, assignments and tests, available to other students.

This is a project that I would like to commit to working on, and hopefully have finished by January 2023. This isn't really a life-changing thing, but it will help we along my journey of learning HTML and css, and allow me to get back into coding.
